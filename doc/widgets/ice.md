ICE
===

Displays one line per instance that shows how the instanceâ€™s prediction changes when a feature changes.

**Inputs**

- Model: model
- Data: dataset

The **ICE** (Individual Conditional Expectation) widget visualizes the dependence of the prediction on a feature for each instance separately, resulting in one line per instance, compared to one line overall in partial dependence plots.
